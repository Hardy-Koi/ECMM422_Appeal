    "5. do not remove the function `save_history()` at the end of each cell. This function will save your edit operations on the code in the cell and will be used as proof of work, i.e. proof that you have been working on the questions assigned\n",
    "6. work always in the cells provided when developing your implementation, i.e. do not work on another notebook or with programming environments that do not operate on this notebook.\n",
    "7. when you are finished debugging **remove** all code that is not part of the function definition, i.e. leave only the clean function implementation in the cell: do not leave debugging `print` statements in the functions, and do not leave function invocations on test inputs\n",

    "- Each function is awarded a number of marks. \n",
    "- One or more hidden unit tests are going to evaluate if all desired properties of the required function are met. \n",
    "- If the function passes a test all the associated marks are awarded, if it fails 0 marks are awarded.\n",
    "- If you make a typo error (e.g. misspelling a variable) this will likely causes a syntax error, the function execution will fail and you will be awarded 0 marks.\n",
    "- Do not make assumptions on the state of previous cells, i.e. expect each function to be evaluated independently, moreover expect each function to be tested in the unit tests on some *randomly* generated input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the test use a hard fail/pass strategy to assign marks, the presence of several questions and several unit tests per question allows a fine grading. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Checkpoints are not graded by default, but might be used to assign additional marks in case the execution of the code obtains the desired results even when some tests might fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Efficiency:** There is a cap of a few minutes on the execution of each cell and unit test. Make sure your code is not terribly inefficient (for example having a cell run for hours, e.g. using nested loops rather than NumPy functions that can work directly on  arrays), otherwise the execution of the cell/unit test will be interrupted and considered a failure.

    "### **Details**  \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to implement a sequence of functions to generate, process, and visualize a synthetic dataset composed of images containing geometric shapes. These images will serve as input for a classification task, where the assigned label depends on the relative sizes of circles and squares within each image. The dataset is designed to provide a structured yet randomized environment for machine learning models to learn shape-based classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each generated image contains a combination of geometric shapes—**circles, squares, and triangles**—drawn with different sizes and colors. The placement of these shapes is randomized while ensuring they do not overlap significantly. To assign a meaningful classification label, the **relative areas** of circles and squares in the image are compared. Based on this comparison, images are categorized into one of three classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class 0**: The largest square in the image is significantly larger than the largest circle.  \n",
    "- **Class 2**: The largest circle in the image is significantly larger than the largest square.  \n",
    "- **Class 1**: The largest circle and square are of similar size.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, the assignment is divided into a set of interconnected functions, each responsible for a different aspect of dataset generation, image processing, or visualization. Below, we explain how these functions work together in a **logical pipeline**, from image creation to dataset preparation and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How the Functions Work Together**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following functions are implemented sequentially to ensure that each step builds upon the previous ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generating Colors for Shapes (`generate_color_palette`)**  \n",
    "   - Before drawing any shapes, we need a set of **distinct colors** to make the images visually diverse.  \n",
    "   - This function **randomly generates a palette** of RGB colors that will be used when drawing shapes in the images.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Creating and Scaling Individual Images (`generate_image` & `scale_image`)**  \n",
    "   - Each image is initialized as a **blank white canvas**.  \n",
    "   - A minimum of **one circle, one square, and one triangle** is drawn using the corresponding shape-drawing functions:  \n",
    "     - `draw_circle`, `draw_square`, and `draw_triangle` each draw a shape and return its computed area.  \n",
    "   - To **avoid overlap**, the function `check_overlap` verifies that new shapes do not collide with existing ones before placement.  \n",
    "   - Once all shapes are placed, the image is resized to the required resolution using `scale_image`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assigning Classification Labels (`assign_label`)**  \n",
    "   - After an image is generated, we **analyze the largest square and circle** in the image.  \n",
    "   - Based on the **relative size difference** between the two, a label (`0`, `1`, or `2`) is assigned.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generating the Full Dataset (`generate_dataset`)**  \n",
    "   - This function **calls `generate_image` multiple times** to create `num_samples` images.  \n",
    "   - The images are stored in a NumPy array `X`, and their corresponding labels (computed using `assign_label`) are stored in `y`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Displaying Sample Images (`display_sample_images`)**  \n",
    "   - After generating the dataset, we need a way to **visually inspect** the images and their assigned labels.  \n",
    "   - This function **randomly selects images** from the dataset and displays them in a grid using Matplotlib.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **End-to-End Pipeline Flow**\n",
    "To summarize, the entire dataset creation and visualization pipeline follows this order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate a color palette** for shape diversity (`generate_color_palette`).  \n",
    "2. **For each image:**\n",
    "   - Create a blank canvas.  \n",
    "   - Draw at least one of each shape type (`draw_circle`, `draw_square`, `draw_triangle`).  \n",
    "   - Ensure shapes do not overlap (`check_overlap`).  \n",
    "   - Resize the image to a consistent resolution (`scale_image`).  \n",
    "3. **Assign a classification label** based on shape sizes (`assign_label`).  \n",
    "4. **Repeat the process for multiple images** to form a dataset (`generate_dataset`).  \n",
    "5. **Visualize a few sample images** to verify dataset correctness (`display_sample_images`).  \n",

    "In the context of the `true_positive_rate` and `false_positive_rate` functions, the `preds` input is expected to be a **one-dimensional NumPy array** containing the predicted probabilities for the **positive class (class 1)**. This means that for each instance in the dataset, `preds[i]` represents the model's estimated probability that the corresponding instance belongs to class 1. When using models that provide probability outputs, such as `predict_proba` from `sklearn`'s `SVC` with `probability=True`, the output is a **two-dimensional array** with shape `(n_samples, 2)`, where the first column corresponds to the probability of class 0, and the second column corresponds to the probability of class 1. Since we are interested in assessing the model's performance in distinguishing the positive class, we must extract the probabilities for class 1 using `preds = model.predict_proba(X)[:, 1]` before passing them to the `true_positive_rate` and `false_positive_rate` functions. This ensures that the sorting and cumulative calculations are performed correctly, leading to meaningful ROC curves and AUC scores.\n",

    "The `scores_list` parameter in the `compute_tpr_fpr_range` function is a **list of one-dimensional NumPy arrays**, where each array contains the predicted probabilities for class 1 from different models, resampling iterations, or cross-validation folds. Each element in `scores_list` corresponds to a single experiment or model run, and it holds the probability estimates for all test samples in that run. The shape of each array inside `scores_list` is `(n_samples,)`, meaning it contains a probability value for each test instance. Since different models or resampling iterations might slightly vary in their predictions, `scores_list` allows us to capture the variability and compute **quantile-based confidence intervals** for the ROC curve. When using `predict_proba` from an `sklearn` classifier, it is essential to extract the probabilities for class 1 before appending them to `scores_list`, ensuring that each stored array follows the correct format:  \n",

    "### **Image Patch Descriptors and Grid-Based Set Kernel for SVM Classification**  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### **Overall Idea and Motivation**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will implement a series of functions to extract **localized features from images** and use them to compute a **custom kernel function** for classification using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. Instead of representing an image as a **single high-dimensional vector of pixel values**, we will break it down into **smaller, structured regions (patches)** and compute **descriptive statistics** about their color distributions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows us to capture **spatial and structural information** within an image, making it particularly useful for **image classification tasks** where different regions contribute uniquely to the overall meaning of an image. Rather than relying on raw pixel intensities, we analyze **how colors are distributed and arranged** within the image.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we follow a structured process:  \n",
    "1. **Grid-Based Patch Extraction** - The image is divided into a uniform grid of **smaller patches**, ensuring that local patterns are preserved.  \n",
    "2. **Feature Computation per Patch** - For each patch, we extract **color-based statistics** that describe the **distribution and spatial arrangement of colors**, rather than their specific RGB values.  \n",
    "3. **Patch Descriptor Aggregation** - These localized features are **aggregated** into a compact descriptor that summarizes the entire image.  \n",
    "4. **Custom Kernel Computation** - A **grid-based set kernel function** is used to compare images based on their **patch-level feature representations**.  \n",
    "5. **SVM Classification** - The computed kernel is used to train an **SVM classifier**, allowing us to distinguish between different classes of images based on **structural and color-based similarities**.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### **1. `compute_color_features`**  \n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: right\"><b>[2 marks]</b></div>  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:**  \n",
    "Implement the function **`compute_color_features`**, which extracts **spatial and statistical features** based on the distribution of colors in an image patch. Rather than focusing on the **identity of specific colors**, this function captures **how colors are spatially arranged** within the patch, making it useful for applications where **patterns and structures matter more than absolute color values**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:**  \n",
    "- **`patch`** (`np.ndarray`): A small image region extracted from the larger image, represented as an array of shape `(H, W, 3)`, where `H` and `W` are the height and width of the patch, and `3` corresponds to the RGB color channels.  \n",
    "- **`ignore_color`** (`tuple`): The RGB color that should be ignored when computing features (default is **white** `(255, 255, 255)`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Returns:**  \n",
    "- **`list`**: A list of feature vectors, each describing a distinct color present in the patch (excluding the ignored color).  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Extracted Features (Per Unique Color):**  \n",
    "Each feature vector contains **7 statistical properties** of the corresponding color's spatial distribution:  \n",
    "1. **Area**: The number of pixels belonging to this color in the patch.  \n",
    "2. **Centroid X**: The mean x-coordinate of the pixels of this color.  \n",
    "3. **Centroid Y**: The mean y-coordinate of the pixels of this color.  \n",
    "4. **Variance X**: The spread of pixels along the x-axis (width direction).  \n",
    "5. **Variance Y**: The spread of pixels along the y-axis (height direction).  \n",
    "6. **Skewness X**: The asymmetry in pixel distribution along the x-axis.  \n",
    "7. **Skewness Y**: The asymmetry in pixel distribution along the y-axis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why Color Identity Is Not Considered?**  \n",
    "- **Focus on Structure, Not Specific Colors**: The function extracts **how** colors are arranged, rather than which colors are present.  \n",
    "- **Robust to Color Changes**: Variations in lighting or hue shifts do not affect the computed features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Implementation Notes:**  \n",
    "- Convert the patch into a **set of unique colors** (ignoring the `ignore_color`).  \n",
    "- For each unique color, compute the **7-dimensional feature vector** described above.  \n",
    "- Return a **list of feature vectors**, where each entry corresponds to a different color region in the patch.  \n",

    "**Task:**  \n",
    "Implement the function **`aggregate_features`**, which **combines** the color-based feature vectors extracted by `compute_color_features` into a **single feature representation** for the entire image patch. Instead of treating each color separately, this function **aggregates information** about all colors in a way that reflects their **relative importance** in the patch.\n",

    "**Parameters:**  \n",

    "- **`np.ndarray`**: A **single 7-dimensional feature vector** representing the entire patch.  \n",
    "  - This is computed as a **weighted sum of all individual color features**, where the **weight of each color is its area** (number of pixels it occupies in the patch).  \n",

    "\n",
    " **Weighting by Color Importance**  \n",

    "\n",
    " **Normalization for Consistency**  \n",
    "- To ensure that the final vector is **comparable across patches of different sizes**, the weighted sum is **divided by the total sum of all color areas**.  \n",
    "- This prevents patches with **more pixels** from having disproportionately larger feature values, allowing the representation to capture the **relative distribution of colors, rather than absolute pixel counts**.  \n",

    "#### **Why Proper Initialization is Important?**  \n",
    "Proper initialization of filter weights is **crucial** for stable training and efficient learning in deep networks. Poor initialization can lead to issues such as:  \n",
    "- **Vanishing gradients** (if initialized too small).  \n",
    "- **Exploding gradients** (if initialized too large).  \n",
    "- **Slow convergence** if initialization does not match the expected scale of activations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Initialization Strategies**\n",
    "\n",
    "A common strategy is to initialize weights using a **scaled normal distribution** based on the number of input connections per neuron. The two widely used methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Xavier (Glorot) Initialization**: Suitable for activations with **sigmoid** or **tanh** functions.  \n",
    "  - Variance:  \n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\frac{1}{\\text{fan}_{\\text{in}} + \\text{fan}_{\\text{out}}}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **He Initialization**: Suitable for **ReLU-based** networks, where positive activations dominate.  \n",
    "  - Variance:  \n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\frac{2}{\\text{fan}_{\\text{in}}}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    (This helps prevent the outputs from shrinking.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How you should implement it in `ConvLayer`**  \n",
    "You could use the **He initialization** since convolutional layers precede ReLU activation functions. The standard deviation can be scaled as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{scale} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\text{kernel\\_size} \\times \\text{kernel\\_size} \\times \\text{input\\_channels}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each filter weight can be initialized using a normal distribution centered at `0` with this computed standard deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "scale = np.sqrt(2.0 / (kernel_size * kernel_size * input_channels))\n",
    "self.filters = np.random.randn(num_filters, input_channels, kernel_size, kernel_size) * scale\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This would ensures that:  \n",
    "- The weights start with an appropriate scale for stable learning.  \n",
    "- Gradient magnitudes are balanced across layers, preventing vanishing/exploding gradients.  \n",
    "- Each filter learns meaningful spatial features efficiently.  \n",

    "### **Description of `dL_dout` in Backpropagation**  \n",
    "\n",
    "`dL_dout` represents the **gradient of the loss function with respect to the output of the final layer** in the network. It is a key component in backpropagation, allowing the model to update its parameters by propagating the error signal backward through the layers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How `dL_dout` is Computed**\n",
    "- During training, the network computes predictions (`probs`), which are probability distributions obtained via the **softmax function**.\n",
    "- The loss is typically computed using **categorical cross-entropy**, defined as:  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  L = - \\sum_{i} y_i \\log(\\hat{y_i})\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  where $ y $ is the true label (one-hot encoded) and $ \\hat{y} $ is the predicted probability.\n",
    "- The gradient of the loss with respect to the network’s output (logits) is:  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  dL_dout = \\hat{y} - y\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  This is derived from the fact that the derivative of cross-entropy loss combined with softmax simplifies to this expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Shape of `dL_dout`**\n",
    "- The output layer contains `num_classes` neurons, so `dL_dout` has shape **`(num_classes, 1)`**.\n",
    "- Each element in `dL_dout` corresponds to how much the loss would change if the respective logit were adjusted.\n",
    "- This gradient is then passed backward through the **fully connected layer**, allowing weight updates via gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, `dL_dout` serves as the starting point for backpropagation, determining how adjustments should be made to improve the network’s predictions.\n",

    "## **Final Notes**\n",
    "- **Why Implement `conv2d_numpy` from Scratch?**\n",
    "  - Convolution is the **core operation** of CNNs.\n",
    "  - This exercise **reinforces mathematical intuition** about feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why No Backprop for Conv & Pool Layers?**\n",
    "  - In a real deep learning framework, **conv layers** use **backpropagation** to update weights.\n",
    "  - Here, we **only update weights in the fully connected layer** to simplify training.\n",

    "The model is indeed learning. If the accuracy of the test set is similar to that of the training set, it indicates that the model has good generalization ability. But if the test accuracy is significantly lower than the training set, it may indicate that the model is overfitting - that is, it remembers the training data but performs poorly on new data. "
